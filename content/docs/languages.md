[Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) shows the shortest path to a language: call
`grammars.GoLanguage()`, hand it to `gts.NewParser`, and parse. This page is the deep reference
behind that call — the registry those `XLanguage()` functions live in, what a
`*gotreesitter.Language` actually is, how to load one you did not compile in, and the full list of
the 206 grammars gotreesitter ships.

## Loading a built-in language

Every embedded grammar has a matching `XLanguage() *gotreesitter.Language` function in the
`grammars` package — `GoLanguage()`, `PythonLanguage()`, `RustLanguage()`, and so on for all 206:

```go
import (
	gts "github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter"
	"github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter/grammars"
)

lang := grammars.GoLanguage()
parser := gts.NewParser(lang)

tree, err := parser.Parse([]byte("package main\n\nfunc main() {}\n"))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
fmt.Println(tree.RootNode().Type(lang)) // "source_file"
```

The function name does not always spell the grammar name literally: the `c_sharp` grammar's
loader is `CSharpLanguage()`, following Go naming instead of a literal mirror. If you are not sure
of the exact identifier, do not guess — resolve a `LangEntry` from the registry (next section) and
call its `Language` field instead of hardcoding a function name.

Each `XLanguage()` call is cheap after the first: the loader decompresses the blob once and caches
it, so calling `grammars.GoLanguage()` from multiple goroutines or in a loop does not repeat the
work.

## The registry: `LangEntry` and `AllLanguages`

The `grammars` package keeps every built-in grammar in an internal registry, exposed read-only
through `grammars.AllLanguages() []LangEntry`. Calling it is metadata-only — it does **not**
decompress any blob or build any parse table, so it is safe to call on every request, not just at
startup:

```go
entries := grammars.AllLanguages()
fmt.Println(len(entries)) // 206

for _, e := range entries {
	fmt.Println(e.Name, e.Extensions)
}
```

`LangEntry` (`grammars/registry.go`) is the full record behind each name:

| Field | Type | What it's for |
|---|---|---|
| `Name` | `string` | Canonical grammar name — `"go"`, `"c_sharp"`, `"embedded_template"`. What `AllLanguages`, `Register`, and file detection key on. |
| `Extensions` | `[]string` | File suffixes with the leading dot, e.g. `[".go"]` or `[".js", ".mjs", ".cjs"]` for JavaScript. Feeds `DetectLanguage`. |
| `Shebangs` | `[]string` | Exact shebang-line prefixes to match. Unset on every built-in today — shebang detection instead runs off an internal linguist-interpreter table (`#!/usr/bin/env python3` → `python`), which `DetectLanguageByShebang` also consults. The field is for a language that needs an exact, non-table match. |
| `Language` | `func() *gotreesitter.Language` | The lazy loader: first call decodes the grammar, later calls return the cached result. This is what an `XLanguage()` function like `GoLanguage()` actually is. |
| `GrammarSource` | `GrammarSource` | How the grammar was produced: `"ts2go_blob"` (extracted from upstream C `parser.c`), `"grammargen_blob"` (compiled by gotreesitter and shipped as a blob), or `"grammargen"` (generated at runtime with no embedded blob — how out-of-tree `RegisterExtension` callers typically register). |
| `HighlightQuery` | `string` | The tree-sitter `highlights.scm` text, for syntax-highlighting integrations. |
| `InheritHighlights` | `string` | Parent language whose highlight query gets prepended to this one's (child overrides win). Unset on every built-in; meant for an extension language composing with an existing grammar. |
| `TagsQuery` | `string` | A `tags.scm` query for symbol extraction, when explicitly authored. No built-in ships one explicitly — call `grammars.ResolveTagsQuery(entry)` instead of reading the field directly; it infers a query from the grammar's symbols and caches the result. |
| `TokenSourceFactory` | `func(src []byte, lang *gotreesitter.Language) gotreesitter.TokenSource` | Non-nil only for languages with a hand-written Go token source instead of the DFA lexer (default build: `authzed`, `c`, `cpp`, `go`, `java`, `json`, `lua`). Pass its result to `Parser.ParseWithTokenSource`. |
| `Quality` | `ParseQuality` | Reserved for a `full` / `partial` / `none` classification. Every registered entry has it unset (`""`) today — nothing populates it yet, despite the field's doc comment. For a real classification, call `grammars.AuditParseSupport()` instead. |

`AuditParseSupport() []ParseSupport` answers *how* a language will actually parse — DFA lexer,
hand-written token source, or blocked on a missing external scanner — not just that it is
registered. It loads each grammar (so, unlike `AllLanguages`, it is not free) and reports a
`Backend` (`dfa`, `dfa-partial`, `token_source`, `unsupported`) plus a `Reason` for each.

## Finding a language for a file

`DetectLanguage(filename) *LangEntry` — covered in [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) — is
the function you will use most: it checks exact filenames first (`Dockerfile`, `.bashrc`), then
registered extensions longest-suffix-first, then a large table of extended extensions. Three more
functions round out the toolkit for cases `DetectLanguage` does not cover:

```go
entry := grammars.DetectLanguageByName("golang")           // linguist alias -> "go"
entry  = grammars.DetectLanguageByShebang("#!/usr/bin/env python3\n") // -> "python"
name  := grammars.DisplayName(entry)                        // "Go" / "Python", not "go" / "python"
fmt.Println(name)
```

`DetectLanguageByName` accepts linguist's canonical names and common aliases — `"C++"`, `"cpp"`,
`"Go"`, `"golang"`, `"F#"`, `"fsharp"` all resolve — as well as any of gotreesitter's own grammar
names, and (for extensions registered through `RegisterExtension`) their markdown fence aliases.
`DisplayName` runs the inverse direction for UI: it returns the human title for a grammar name,
falling back to title-casing the name itself when no curated entry exists.

## Loading a language dynamically

Everything above assumes the grammar you want is already compiled into your binary. When it is
not — you are building a plugin system, serving grammars to WASM on demand, or shipping a grammar
your own module generated — load a blob at runtime instead:

```go
blob := grammars.BlobByName("python")       // encoded blob; nil if not embedded
lang, err := grammars.LoadLanguage("python", blob)
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
tree, err := gts.NewParser(lang).Parse([]byte("x = 1\n"))
if err != nil {
	panic(err)
}
_ = tree
```

`grammars.BlobByName(name string) []byte` returns the same compressed bytes the registry decodes
internally. This is useful for shipping a grammar to a browser-side WASM module or another
process, since every built-in today is blob-backed (`ts2go_blob` or `grammargen_blob`; no
built-in uses the no-blob `grammargen` source).

There are two `LoadLanguage` functions, and the difference matters:

- **`gotreesitter.LoadLanguage(data []byte) (*Language, error)`** (root package) only
  deserializes the blob. It is the only function you need to load a pre-compiled grammar, with no
  other dependency, no `grammargen` import, and no registry.
- **`grammars.LoadLanguage(name string, data []byte) (*gotreesitter.Language, error)`** runs the
  same deserialization, then attaches any external scanner and external-lex-state table
  registered under `name`. Use this one whenever the language has an external scanner — see
  [External Scanners](/docs/external-scanners) — or you will get a `Language` that silently
  cannot recognize its context-sensitive tokens.

Both run the same post-load repair pass (`InferGeneratedRepeatAuxMetadata`); only the `grammars`
loader also attaches scanners. Pick one door and load through it consistently.

Writing and shipping your own grammar this way — with the pipeline that produces the blob in the
first place — is the subject of [Authoring Languages](/docs/authoring-languages).

### Blob metadata and certification in v0.54.0

New blobs carry a version header. `lang.BlobInfo()` reports it after loading.
The loader still accepts legacy blobs and limits decompressed data to 64 MiB by default.
See [Authoring Languages](/docs/authoring-languages) for encoding and limit controls.

`grammars.DecodeAndCertifyLanguageBlob(name, data)` is also exported in v0.54.0.
It uses the built-in loader's repair and certification path, then attaches the registered
scanner and external lex states. This does not certify arbitrary grammar data as C-equivalent.
See [the implementation](https://github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter/blob/v0.55.1/grammars/runtime/embedded_loader.go).

## Why `Type`, `SExpr`, and field lookups take a `*Language`

[Syntax Trees and Nodes](/docs/syntax-trees-and-nodes) covers the `Node` API in full. Here is the
short version of *why* four of its methods — `Type(lang)`, `SExpr(lang)`,
`ChildByFieldName(name, lang)`, `FieldNameForChild(i, lang)` — need a language argument, a
registry detail worth knowing here.

A `Node` never stores its type or field names as strings. It stores a `Symbol` — a `uint16` — and,
per child, a `FieldID`, also a `uint16`. The strings live once, in the `*Language` that produced
them: `Language.SymbolNames []string` and `Language.FieldNames []string`, indexed by those IDs.
`Type(lang)` resolves to exactly `lang.SymbolNames[node.Symbol()]`, unescaped for display. This is
not an arbitrary API choice: `Node` is a fixed 104-byte struct with a size ratchet enforced by a
test (`TestNodeLayoutSizeBudget` in `tree_test.go`), and a syntax tree can hold millions of nodes.
An 8-byte `*Language` pointer on every single one would be pure overhead for information the tree
already carries once, on `Tree.Language()`. The header has fallen from 152 bytes through several
memory releases, but millions of pointer-rich Go nodes still cost more than C's compact subtrees;
the [Performance](/docs/performance) page records the current memory receipts.

In practice you rarely thread `lang` by hand past the initial parse: `tree.Language()` returns the
same `*Language` the tree was parsed with, so `root.Type(tree.Language())` works from any node
descended from that tree, with no need to keep your own reference around.

## Recovery election isn't a `LangEntry` field — check the `Language`

[Recovery and Correctness](/docs/recovery-and-correctness) covers gotreesitter's C-faithful
recovery election model in full: a language only gets the C-faithful recovery path once it is
both capability-checked and explicitly certified. That status is **not** exposed on `LangEntry` —
there is no `Elected bool` you can read off `AllLanguages()`. It lives on the loaded `*Language`
itself, as `CRecoveryCostCompetitionCapable` and `CRecoveryCostCompetitionEnabledByDefault`:

```go
entry := grammars.DetectLanguageByName("rust")
lang := entry.Language()
fmt.Println(lang.CRecoveryCostCompetitionEnabledByDefault) // true: rust is elected
```

Inspect these flags on each loaded language. This page does not claim a current aggregate
recovery-election count. Certification is specific to the grammar and tested inputs.

## The full catalog

The [v0.55.1 language guide](https://github.com/odvcencio/gotreesitter/blob/v0.55.1/docs/languages.md)
reports 206 registry grammars, 119 external scanners, and seven hand-written token-source
implementations. A token-source implementation is not the same as a non-nil factory on every
registry entry. Build tags can change the registry. Inspect `AllLanguages` for your build.

The default catalog is listed below.

That list holds grammar *names* — the registry key and the argument to `DetectLanguageByName`.
Several map to more than one extension (`javascript` covers `.js`, `.mjs`, `.cjs`); a few read
differently from the file type's common name (`c_sharp` for `.cs`, `embedded_template` for ERB).
When in doubt, resolve by filename with `DetectLanguage` instead of guessing the registry name
from the extension.
